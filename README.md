Repos
=====

Gizmo for the tool belt of industrious developers to keep track of all your local repos.

**Assumption:** You have multiple (git/vcs) repositories and often work on multiple over the day / time.

**Problem:** Forgetting to push some vs the hassle of checking each repo directory.

**Solution:** Track all repos *globally* and check if anything has been forgotten with one command.

In addition, this tool serves as a demo command line application showcasing [CLIF (CLI Framework)](https://github.com/ukautz/clif).
